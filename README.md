1) Project Description:

This project analyzes large-scale road accident datasets to uncover patterns and factors influencing accident severity and frequency. Via dynamic dashboards, it empowers stakeholders to monitor trends and prioritize resources effectively.

2) Tools & Technologies:

Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis
SQL: Data extraction and querying from databases
Power BI & Tableau: Interactive dashboard and data visualization creation

3) Data Sources:

Road accident datasets including accident details, severity, weather, vehicle type, and location attributes.

4) Step-by-Step Process:

Data Collection & Extraction-

Gather raw accident data from available sources.
Use SQL queries to extract relevant subsets for analysis.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing-

Perform data cleaning using Excel: handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
Create new features/columns (e.g., Year, Month).

Data Analysis-

Use Excel pivot tables for preliminary insights.
Perform SQL aggregations for summaries.

Dashboard Development-

Develop visuals for key metrics: severity distribution, temporal trends, geographical hotspots.
Design interactive elements like slicers/filters for user-driven exploration.
Utilize Power BI and Tableau for rich data visualization.

Insights & Interpretation-

Identify high-risk conditions, temporal patterns, and spatial clusters.
Provide recommendations to stakeholders based on data.

5) Key Insights:

Accident severity mostly slight but serious/fatal remain critical.
Weather and lighting conditions influence accident likelihood.
Temporal trends show recurring peak periods.
Geographic hotspots identified for targeted intervention.

6) How to Use the Dashboard:

Select filters to explore accident data by time, location, or conditions.
Analyze KPIs and charts for quick decision-making.
Export reports for further review.

7) Future Enhancements:

Automate data updates with live database connections.
Integrate more granular vehicle and driver behavior data.
Incorporate predictive analytics for risk forecasting.
